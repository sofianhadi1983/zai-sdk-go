    # Additional linters:
    - gofmt        # Check whether code was gofmt-ed
    - goimports    # Check import statements are formatted according to goimport
    - gosec        # Inspect source code for security problems
    - misspell     # Find commonly misspelled English words
    - revive       # Fast, configurable, extensible, flexible, and beautiful linter for Go
    - typecheck    # Like the front-end of a Go compiler, parses and type-checks Go code
    - unparam      # Report unused function parameters
    - goconst      # Find repeated strings that could be replaced by a constant
    - gocyclo      # Compute and check the cyclomatic complexity of functions
    - dupl         # Tool for code clone detection
    - prealloc     # Find slice declarations that could potentially be preallocated
    - unconvert    # Remove unnecessary type conversions
    - wastedassign # Find wasted assignment statements
    - nolintlint   # Report ill-formed or insufficient nolint directives
    - bodyclose    # Check whether HTTP response body is closed successfully
    - exportloopref # Check for pointers to enclosing loop variables
    - gocritic     # Provides diagnostics that check for bugs, performance and style issues
